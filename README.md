Pkl https://pkl-lang.org/index.html is a language for writing configuration files. 
It is a higher-level language that removes the drudgery and error-prone repetitive work often involved with configuration files.
It can output JSON files.

Therefore, it is potentially ideal for working with ICD-DB model files, which are often repetitive and error-prone.

Initially this project supports the FITS file support provided in ICD-DB, but should be able to be extended easily to create
model files for assemblies, etc.

One advantage of using pkl is that there is an Intellij plugin that provides hints and enforces types and values.
