Pkl https://pkl-lang.org/index.html is a language for writing configuraiton files. 
It is a higher-level language that removes the drudgery and error-prone repetitive work often involved with configuration files.
It can output JSON files.

Therefore, it is potentially ideal for working with ICD-DB model files, which are often repetitive and error prone.

Initially this project supports the FITS file support provided in ICD-DB, but should be able to be extended easily to create
model files for assemblies, etc.
